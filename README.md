# Cyber-Security-Key-Log
Key Logger made for educational purposes only.
This was only made to understand how cyber attacks work, it is not and has never been designed for actual use in an attack.
As a result I am NOT respsonsible for any ill-intent this program could potentially be used for. 
This key logger won't run automatically unless the user presses to execute the program themselves as it was never designed to do so.
